# light-game
A light follows your cursor and gets larger and more intense the faster you move.

There are slightly visible triangles vibrating somewhere in the dark. Something bad might happen if one of them sees you.

There is also a green square. Try to find it and see what happensðŸ‘€

- If the issue persists, check for driver updates for your graphics card or monitor.
- If the issue still persists, post an issue on this GitHub repo with as much information as possible.
