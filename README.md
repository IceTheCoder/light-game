# light-game
You have been cursed to one of the simplest forms: light. The faster you move, the larger you grow.

Avoid triangles. They are your enemies.

Find the green square to win.

**Download (Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android) and browser: https://icethegamedev.itch.io/light-game.**

**Browser-only: https://icethegamedev.github.io/light-game/WebGL/.**

## Notices
- If you encounter issues with the light's size and intensity (such as a gradual increase in size and intensity without moving the cursor), try plugging in your device.
- If the issue persists, check for driver updates for your graphics card or monitor.
- If the issue still persists, post an issue on this GitHub repo or comment on the itch.io page for the game.
